# Technology Task 1 & 2: Creating a Tutorial & Presentation

Your group will write a tutorial for the special topic assigned to your group from Proposal #1.

## Individual Assignment

Every group member must read and **study** Lecture 24 of the course lecture notes on Technical Writing. All team members must use the suggestions and guidelines found in these notes.

## Group Assignment

Choose anyone as a project manager to coordinate for this assignment. The intended audience for your tutorial is a student who has completed Software II at OSU (CSE 2231, aka CSE 321) but who has not yet taken CSE 3901.

The format of your tutorial should be a web site. You may use Middleman to generate the web site, along with associated technologies (e.g., Markdown, ERb, YAML). You can also use a syntax highlighting library such as coderay, rouge, or highlight.js. Web-design frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation, however, are not permitted.

Do NOT simply copy/paste text from a third party source. **This will receive no credit!** All writing must be authored solely by your team members and written from scratch. The point of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to improve on your writing skills.

Your team must ensure that the there is an equal subdivision of the work load. Indicate this by including the original author of a the tutorial. ALL team members are responsible for quality assurance, e.g. proof reading the entire document. All team members are responsible for proper integration of the sections which will require substantial communication between the project managers and the group as a whole.

The grading of your team's work will include the following criterion (amongst other possible factors) and submission of materials as listed below:

* Completeness: Does your document cover the subject well enough that the above audience members are able to start effectively using the technology or framework?
* Integration: Does your document read as a coherent document where parts from different author's have been integrated well? You should pay attention to consistency between and within sections. All team members must communicate well in order to coordinate their writing and spend time together to combine all work. The reader should seamlessly understand how these parts fit together without distractions and feel as if they are reading about this topic from a single writer.
* You should include examples, figures, tables, and code samples.
* Optionally, you can also include "supplemental materials" such as a web site, or a collection of sample code. This should be kept to a minimum and should be intended to complement, not supplant, the tutorial document. Your writing should stand on its own content. Extended examples that are developed in the text of the tutorial are a natural choice for supplemental materials.
* Outlines Provide outlines and drafts that led up to your final document. Not providing these will result in a reduction in the team's grade for this assignment. Also identify where appropriate what level(s) of cognition (Bloom's Taxonomy) you were using in your writing.
* Readme text file (see below) that also contains all of the references you used to research your material. Using only a single reference will receive a point deduction

## Submission
The graders will retrieve your work (readme plus your solution) from your team's Github private repository provided for you under the course's organization cse3901-osu-2015au. Include a readme text file which contains the names of each project manager and states what each team member specifically contributed to the final submission. For the latter, only report on contributions that made it into to the final solution. Also indicate which team members participated in proof reading a section.
