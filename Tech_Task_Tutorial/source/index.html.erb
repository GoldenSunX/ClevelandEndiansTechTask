              The Cleveland Endiansâ€™ RSpec tutorial was created to help you learn, comprehend, and construct RSpec unit tests for
              the Ruby programming language. Using RSpec while creating Ruby applications can greatly improve your programming
              capabilities and speed up deployment of your application. RSpec is used extensively by agile developers who
              practice Test Driven Development because it greatly reduces the amount of errors and bugs in their code.
