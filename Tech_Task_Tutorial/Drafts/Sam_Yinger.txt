Expectations:

Summary:
An Expectation is a statement in an ‘it block’ that uses the expect() block. The format should look similar
to 'expect(resultValue).to eq(expectedValue)'

expect(2 + 2).to eq(4) #this is true since 2 + 2 = 4

This statement is crucial to be able to test the behavior of your ruby code. You know how a method or module should
work and you can check to see if it meets expectations. In the example we can see that we insert what
the function/method/module is supposed to return to happen inside of the parenthesis so we can
compare it to other values for the sake of testing testing.

You should also be aware that there is an older expectation format that you might see if you are reviewing test
cases that had been made previously. This format is similar to '(resultValue).should eq(expectedValue)'

(2 + 1).should eq(3) #this is true since 2 + 1 = 3

It is important to bve aware of of this format only in case you encounter older ruby rspec cases.
Other than that you should always use the expect() format since it is the current up-to-date format for rspec testing.


Audience / Prerequisites:
The following tutorial is for beginner Ruby programmers who would like to incorporate RSpec into their Ruby code. To
get the most out of the tutorial, it is recommended you first understand basic programming concepts and practices.
After you have completed the tutorial, you will be able to successfully incorporate RSpec unit tests into your Ruby
applications.
