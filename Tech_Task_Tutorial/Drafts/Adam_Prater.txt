Rough Draft of Tech Task -- Adam Prater

Filtering:

Syntax:

Filtering is what allows a user to run only a select group of test cases.
Instead of having to run every test case in a spec file, filtering allows the user
to run only test cases that meet a certain criteria.

Command:

Discuss the syntax where the tags are used to define a test as part of a certain category.
This is used through meta data with the syntax, positive (any variable): true.
This is setting this test case as part of the positive test case group.

Output:

To run the positive test cases use the command, "rspec --tag positive filter_spec.rb".
The use of "--tag" then the variable name is what runs a certain category of test cases.

Following the output will display the filtered test cases and show how many failed as well
as the tag specification.
