Outline:
Information about tags
	What are tags?
	How are tags useful?
	Example image of a tag being used to specify running only specific tests
	Example of running rspec tests with that specified tag.

Information about subjects
	Talk about importance of clean and easy to write tests.
	Ruby – terse code is considered good practice, even in tests
	What a subject is
	How using subjects simplifies the code
	Example of how code can be simplified with a subject

Information about helpers
	Code reusability – can test one method and ensure it is correct instead of adding more points to 	break your own tests – Single Point of Control
	Helper methods in rspec allow for this to be simple, as you can define whatever methods you 	want within the describe statement
	Example of a helper within the rspec test file, showing its scope

	Show example using modules and Rspec.configure to allow all tests to use methods within the 	module

Information about metadata
	Sometimes you want to know more information about the tests rspec is running
	Rspec keeps track of data about every unit test being run
	Show example of printing out metadata
	Talk about what information is held in the metadata hash
	Talk about the hash’s scope, and how the metadata allows you to declare variables at different scopes within the describe code block.

	Possibly tie into filtering
